### Features

These services can perform,

#### Create User

To create a user, the endpoint **/api/users** must be consumed with the following parameters:

```bash
  Method: POST
```

```json
{
    "dni": "dni",
    "name": "name"
}
```

If the response is successful, the service will return an HTTP Status 200 and a message with the following structure:

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "dni": "dni",
    "name": "name"
}
```

If the response is unsuccessful, we will receive status 400 and the following message:

```json
{
    "error": "error"
}
```

#### Get Users

To get all users, the endpoint **/api/users** must be consumed with the following parameters:

```bash
  Method: GET
```

If the response is successful, the service will return an HTTP Status 200 and a message with the following structure:

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "dni": "dni",
        "name": "name"
    }
]
```

#### Get User

To get an user, the endpoint **/api/users/<id>** must be consumed with the following parameters:

```bash
  Method: GET

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "dni": "dni",

}
```

If the user id does not exist, we will receive status 404 and the following message:

```json
{
    "error": "User not found: <id>"
}
```
